            <h3>•	What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
            <p>
              I learnt that I also tend to assume that once I learn something it will stay the same, which is a dangerous habit. I think at this point in time I need to be more wary of the ways that I learn just as much as the things that I learn, I also learnt that I have lived my life for a long time with a fixed mindset, and how unhealthy this can be.
            </p>
            <h3>•	What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <p>
              I believe that these roles play a large part in ensuring that programmers learning and coming into the market in the future find it easier to bond and form connections with both fellow employees and employers, but also with customers in more customer facing roles.
            </p>
            <h3>•	What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p>
              That I have lot to learn, and need to be more careful about being arrogant and thinking I already understand something therefore do not need to continue learning about said thing. There is always new ways of approaching learning and new methods to learn things.
            </p>
            <h3>•	What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>
              Sometimes purely making myself sit down and actually write out the blog post content can be the hardest thing to overcome. Due to the type of writing it actually is, I find it a lot more challenging to push myself through that task then I did with doing a lot of the more tech related stuff.
            </p>
            <h3>•	Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>
              Because currently there is a stereotype of programmers being social outcasts, and unable to actually connect with customers or co workers due to lack of ability when it comes to expressing feelings, connecting with people and having empathy and understanding.
            </p>
            <h3>•	Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead?</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely not. Some of the time I have spent on core learning has been far more beneficial for my mental health and my overall learning experience then anything in the tech spectrum. I think it is a good practice to be learning so much core over just purely tech, and will reflect on the next generation of programmers.
