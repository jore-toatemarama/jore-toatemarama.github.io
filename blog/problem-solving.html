        <h3>A time you were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
            <p>
              <h4>what was the problem?</h4>
              While learning Javascript during my 4th sprint, I was trying to create a bit of code that finds what door scooby doo is hiding behind, and then tells you. during this i ran into a problem when I got confused by the layering of the objects in the code.
              <h4>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
              I ran through my code, compared it to the test solution as well as the test code as seeing the difference helped me to understand where the problem was, I also used the rubber ducky method trying to talk myself through the process and why it wasnt working but i still needed help understanding what the problem was, I eventually spoke with a facilitator for help and they advised where I could be making a mistake
              <h4> how did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
              Confused, It gets quite difficult to understand where a problem lies when I dont understand the code fully. it was very satisfying to finally figure out what I was doing wrong however.
              <h4>what did you learn?</h4>
              I learnt more about how the object interaction with the function works. when the find method is used the result that it spits out is put into a new objkect that can be used to then return the result of whatever it is you are testing
            </p>

      <div id="block1">
        <h3>A time you elegantly solved a problem:</h3>
          <p>
            <h4>what was the problem?</h4>
            I recognized that FizzBuzz was going to require mathematics in order to return the values I required, I dislike math and struggle with code when it relates to math
            <h4>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
            I used Google, searched the problem (i.e how to get multiples of a number in JS) and found a line of code that explained what you needed to do, I tested it in the repl and ran it by a facilitator, then proceeded forward once I knew that was mostly out of the way, simple and easy once done.
            <h4>how did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
            stressed out - I dislike mathematics, especially as it gets more confusing, but I feel like its something I need to be more open too
            <h4>what did you learn?</h4>
            That Google is a good friend in situations like these, and that I dont have to worry so much about math considering im working on giant calculator, all I need to do is learn how to ask it for the right answers
          </p>

        <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
          <p>
            <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
            I dont use Pseudocode enough at the moment, I recognize how useful it is, but I find that the inherent knowledge of what I should be writing (i.e what my code is going to look like) is often lacking in those situations. I use it to write a guideline of what I am trying to do with the code, and I will try to do this every single time i do any code in the future as I can definitely recognize its usefulness, hopefully refining it along the way to be more concise and clear
            <h4>Trying something</h4>
            I am great at this, I feel quite confident as its usually my main way of both verifying that something is working/still working or that a problem has been solved. 
            <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
            I have been trying this more and more lately, I feel fairly confident with trying it, however similar to Pseudocode I run into the problem of not understanding what I am trying to accomplish which leads to not being able to explain to myself my code very well, or illustrate any issues.
            <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
            This is definitely something I need to work on, I have been reading them when they appear, but I dont really understand a lot of what I read when big issues come up, with things like testing this becomes much easier and I can more easily see the use of learning to understand the different errors that can come up
            <h4>Console.logging</h4>
            Not something I feel unconfident on, but I should probably be doing this more, I use it when I am in specific situations that I have seen others use it in, but I have yet to make the leap to understanding when it is needed and what specifically to console.log out at the time. other then at the end of the code to see that something is outputting something else that it should be
            <h4>Googling</h4>
            I am fairly happy with my googling skills, definitely something I can see being very useful in a lot of situations in the future. knowing which websites are good is quite useful and something I have been learning more here.
            <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
            THis is probably the BIGGEST thing I need to work on, during foundations I have been behind due to my own situation and this has kept me behind the level that most of the cohort has been at which has made me reluctant to reach out, I understand how crippling this is and am working to remedy the situation, atleast once in bootcamp I wont have any excuses :)
            <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
            I am fairly confident with this, I dont have much issues with asking for assistance from the facilitators, and find them very helpful.
            <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
            Something I would have said was not my strong point at the start of foundations, but I am far more confident in my ability to reflect now and improve from that reflection. it feels good improving on a skill like that especially while in a situation where said skill is extremely useful.
