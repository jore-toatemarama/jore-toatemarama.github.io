        <h3>How do I see myself?</h3>
            <p>
              I am an honest and kind person. I love being creative and see my enjoyment for coding as an extension of that. I am curious and I love learning new things and understanding the world and what’s happening around me. 
              However, I have a tendency to be overly critical, specifically of myself. This has the potential to make whatever path I choose to take more difficult than it needs to be so I try to be aware of when this is becoming a problem and be more kind and understanding of my own growth. 
              I am still learning how to manage this. I am currently undiagnosed (due to the difficulty and cost) but believe I may have ADHD, this has the tendency to be helpful in certain situations but also a hindrance in others, its tricky to know which it will be unless the situation is familiar, which can make me afraid of trying new things

              Joré has always been curious about the world, and, in equal measure, delighted and disappointed by it. He's a critical thinker, intelligent, and embraces robust discussions with people he trusts. 
              He is kind, loving and adores animals (when he was 5 he burst into tears at the supermarket when he realised what meat was). Joré loves simple pleasures: good kai, someone being kind, a dry but clever joke, natural beauty, You Tube videos of dogs doing funny things. 
              He is very intuitive and can sometimes overthink, which can help and hinder his decisions and actions. Having meaning, security, and some control over his environment and his future is important to Joré. When he is happy and comfortable around the people he is with Joré laughs a lot and makes others laugh. He can also talk the pants off you if a topic of conversation comes up that he is especially interested in. 
              Joré is brave: he feels the fear and leans in anyway; he challenges himself and questions everything. He's doing life with his eyes wide open even though he knows that's not the easy journey.

        <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
          <p>
            Thankfully during the course of my life, I haven’t had to make any drastically ethical decisions, but on a smaller scale I have definitely made decisions even about my own ethics that I have questioned or still do, for instance meat eating – I love animals, always have since I was a child, but I also really enjoy food, so understanding and being aware of the fact that animals die to feed people is a hard thing to swallow, on one hand ethically I believe that I shouldn’t eat meat, on the other hand I don’t have strong will power when it comes to my food consumption, as it is somewhat of a comfort. The consequence of continuing to eat meat is quite distressing however, so I have to compromise and try to reduce my consumption at the very least, and hopefully in the future work up to an alternative.
            To be completely honest I don’t know a whole lot about my Island culture as grew up in Wellington as a Kiwi – I do have a rich culture and history on that side of my family that I feel somewhat disconnected from, but it still affects me values and my identity, same as my Pakeha side. I have a strong bond with family and am quite close with a lot of my family, but specifically my Islander family and find it really easy to connect with them. My values have been shaped mostly by my mum and my wider family. And without them I wouldn’t be me.

        <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
          <p>
            I think that my strengths are based around my empathy and understanding, as well as my logical way of thinking, but I also think these strengths can easily become limitations in the wrong circumstances. I think that my ability to communicate and be understanding/listen is going to help a lot during the bootcamp. I think that it accentuates my empathy and helps me to understand the bigger picture in most situations. In the past I have worked with teams in employment roles where sometimes people wouldn’t get along (or would get along too well) In my case I got along a little bit too famously with my co worker at a previous office job, which often meant to much jabbering and not enough working. At the time the solution was to put us in separate areas because we couldn’t really help ourselves and just took to chatting during the boring periods of downtime between calls. However now with maturity and growth I understand why it was wrong of us to waste that time and how it had an impact on both our productivity levels, but also the whole teams and all the people around us. If I was in the same situation today, I wouldn’t hesitate as much to say that I need to focus on my work before spending time talking or getting distracted.
