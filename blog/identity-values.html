        <h3>How do I see myself?</h3>
          <p>I am an honest and kind person. I love being creative and see my enjoyment for coding as an extension of that. I am curious and I love learning new things and understanding the world and what’s happening around me. 
          However, I have a tendency to be overly critical, specifically of myself. This has the potential to make whatever path I choose to take more difficult than it needs to be so I try to be aware of when this is becoming a problem and be more kind and understanding of my own growth. 
          I am still learning how to manage this. I am currently undiagnosed (due to the difficulty and cost) but believe I may have ADHD, this has the tendency to be helpful in certain situations but also a hindrance in others, its tricky to know which it will be unless the situation is familiar, which can make me afraid of trying new things

        <h4>Mum</h4>
          <p>Joré has always been curious about the world, and, in equal measure, delighted and disappointed by it. He's a critical thinker, intelligent, and embraces robust discussions with people he trusts. 
          He is kind, loving and adores animals (when he was 5 he burst into tears at the supermarket when he realised what meat was). Joré loves simple pleasures: good kai, someone being kind, a dry but clever joke, natural beauty, You Tube videos of dogs doing funny things. 
          He is very intuitive and can sometimes overthink, which can help and hinder his decisions and actions. Having meaning, security, and some control over his environment and his future is important to Joré. When he is happy and comfortable around the people he is with Joré laughs a lot and makes others laugh. He can also talk the pants off you if a topic of conversation comes up that he is especially interested in. 
          Joré is brave: he feels the fear and leans in anyway; he challenges himself and questions everything. He's doing life with his eyes wide open even though he knows that's not the easy journey.
