        <h3>•	How is it different to IQ?</h3>
          <p>IQ is a measure of intelligence based on a score derived from standardized tests. This is a good measure of certain types of intelligence (such as the ability to memorize and retain information) EQ on the other hand is not usually measured by a standardized test in the same way, therefore is much harder to define and measure as a number in the same way that IQ is.</p>
