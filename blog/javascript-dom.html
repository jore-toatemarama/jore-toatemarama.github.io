        <h2>What is Javascript & the DOM?</h2>
          <p>If HTML is the foundation and CSS is the decor of your house(website), then Javascript is the electrical wiring, the plumbing, essentially the things that take 
            something from functional to exceptional. Javascript is what lets you really give your website a brain, you can use logic and data from the user and 
            create repeatable functions and loops and much more that exceeds the power you have with just HTML and CSS
          </p>
          <img src="../images/controlflow.png" alt="control flow in java">
          <p>Control Flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script, a good example of this is the if/else statements (as seen above) these allow you
            to create conditions for the code to follow in which one thing can be executed only if some other condition has or has not been met. the Control Flow shows in this 
            example as you must make your if else statements in order - the computer goes through them in a certain order (top to bottom) so this requires thought as to how you
            want your statements to play out. loops are a good example of the control flow getting confusing - because the computer cannot progress past a loop in its usual fashion 
            until it has been completed (or your PC fried) an example to explain these from everyday life I would use, would be reading (for control flow) - most people read in a 
            specific fashion based on their culture, in western literature you read from left to right top to bottom, however in some eastern literature you read right to left instead.
            loops are hard to compare to real life, its exactly like what it sounds, a loop. the code is stuck in said loop until the condition that you define is met. I guess like 
            employment! you are stuck in the loop of employment until you reach the condition of being self sufficient or rich enough to require - whatever you define.
          </p>

          <p>The DOM stands for Document Object Model, it is an API for HTML (and XML) documents. It is representative of the webpage/HTML itself, using it can allow you to change the 
            documents structure, as well as its contents. this is extremely useful for javascript commands for creating an interactive website that can store retain and reuse data 
            in order to make a better experience for the user. you could interact with the DOM in your js code using something like document.getElementById which would scan the document 
            for anything with the ID that is entered into the parameter. this allows you to create js functions, loops, conditions etc that interact with eachother AND the information 
            that is present on the page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Objects can contain almost any form of data stored in a clean container, they differ from Arrays, which are used to hold a list of data. Objects could be used in most situations 
            as they are more of a general use container, whereas Arrays are more specifically used when one needs to access the data in specific ways - basically if your data is an object 
            with specific properties you would store it in an Object, however if its multiple objects that have some property in common, you would would prefer to use the Array.
          </p>

          <p>Functions are like coding recipes, they are basically a list of things you want the computer to do/the code to perform once you execute said function. why is this useful? well 
            for one thing, not having to rewrite every single time you want to repeat a process inside of code is pretty useful for not destroying your hands and keyboard from over typing. 
            but in all seriousness, it seems to me that when it comes to Code - shorter is better in terms of keeping things bug free and running smoothly. The more things that are added, 
            the longer it takes to run through everything, and the higher chance of a mistake being made or something being incompatible, I have noticed I personally have an issue with 
            Hardcoding and I think Functions are a good way for me to remember to think about future proofing my code and making sure its not just a race to pass the finish line.
