        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>Neuroplasticity is important to understand in any topic when it comes to learning and expanding your mind, understanding that people’s brains can be wired entirely differently from the ways that they engage their brains on a daily basis due to neuroplasticity, can help people to understand how to approach learning in the future with a healthier mindset, and to strengthen their neural networks growth. </p>
          <p>I am someone guilty of growing up with a fixed mindset, it has definitely affected my mental health and the way I approach learning and growing. I think that engaging with this growth mindset moving into the future, this will help me a lot with confidence when it comes to learning and feeling inferior if I don’t understand things immediately or as fast as other people. </p>
          <p>Funnily enough I quite enjoy Video games, and was thinking about how the constant repetition of some games would definitely train/increase your neuroplasticity in terms of learning new things. What you learn would likely be based on the game – i.e If you wanted to be a better problem solver, playing puzzle games in your spare time would likely contribute to this. Another example could be making music (or more specifically playing an instrument) or Exercise, it depends on what you want to focus on.</p>

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p>With a Growth Mindset, you approach the world with the belief that your abilities, intelligence and talent are not set in stone. You are able to develop through time and effort, any skill that you put your mind towards and have the resources to develop. This creates a more positive outlook on learning and life, and sets you up for later success through growth. This is relevant to my learning journey at EDA as not only am I someone who has struggled with having a growth mindset in the past, but also is a healthy reminder that I can learn programming and that it is about effort over natural talent or skill. This also helps with imposter syndrome in my experience.</p>
          <p>Personally, a lot of this information surprised me when I first learnt about it, but I didn’t really delve into it I just heard about the terms and a cursory explanation, actually understanding how it works is fascinating and shows that a lot of the predetermined ways I have been approaching life up until this point in regards to learning and growth (and everything else) could be mistaken and should not be treated as foolproof.</p>
          <p>I will make a conscious effort to approach situations within EDA (and eventually the wider world) with a growth mindset as much as I can, I believe that with practice eventually I will default to that over the fixed mindset. I think that understanding that with work and practice I can learn any of the stuff in this course is really mentally cathartic and healthy for future learning.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I think personally that my approach toward learning before knowing about growth vs fixed mindsets is a bit flawed and needs to be reexamined. I have always believed that there is a specific way I learn (practically) that is the best for me, and while this may be true to an extent (I absorb things better or more effectively or faster while doing them) I think learning about Neuroplasticity makes me think that realistically there isn’t just one good way of learning things, and the way I approach ‘success’ when it comes to learning something doesn’t need to be set in stone either. Perhaps my process will get easier if I accept and properly understand that being able to memorize or recite information does not equate to understanding it or having truly learnt it.</p>
