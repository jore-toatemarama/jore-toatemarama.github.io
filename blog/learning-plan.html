          <h3>•	What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
              Similar to during foundations, my although my overall career pathway remains undecided, I do want to do something involving creativity. The way this might look is hard to say. I could possibly work towards using my coding/programming skills for some kind of creative start up or idea that I support, or it could involve finding creativity within roles that aren’t focused on that. Such as working in design but combining that with programming etc. I think either way I want a job that I can somewhat do from home, but also will have coworkers and a good working environment where I can be creative and free within the boundaries of my employment
            </p>
          <h3>•	What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p>
              I think currently based on the everything that has happened up until the start of bootcamp in my personal circumstance, the biggest limitation is my mental health and my concerns around said limitation. I would say my biggest strengths are an interest in knowledge and the topic, and inquisitive mind and a desire to succeed in the course.
            </p>
          <h3>•	What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
            <p>
              Mental Health. I know that Bootcamp will be a big mental/time commitment. And I am quite concerned as to how I will mentally cope with the strain of this level of mental work. I think in normal circumstances I would be stressed about it anyway, even without my added mental load. I just need to be careful not to slip under without reaching out to someone within DA such as Joseph from Human Skills
            </p>
          <h3>•	What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>
              Definitely want to work on my teamwork and communication, I think this is one of the biggest benefits to the upcoming bootcamp, being together physically and working together will help (for me at least) with learning to work as a group and give good feedback which is something I want to get better at. I think the social side of things is really helpful to learn at Dev Academy and I am sad I have fallen behind in foundations and missed out on interacting with a bunch of people.
            </p>
          <h3>•	What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
            <p>
              Similar to the expectations I had for the foundations team – Guidance, support and understanding. I think that there will be a bit more of a hands-on level of learning with being present in the class for a long period of time. I just expect support most of all. Which I can imagine is probably what they are there for ( as well as my co students )
            </p>
          <h3>•	What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
              I will seek out help if required, there are people that have made it clear I can come to them if needed in certain situations, but most of all I am working to be self sufficient enough to get through the course without needing to rely on these things. I am making sure to set up a proper sleep schedule and eating habits to give myself the energy to make it through the course. So at the end I can pat myself on the back and congratulate myself on making it.

          <h3>1.	What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
              I want to do something involving creativity and potentially video games. Learning coding/programming is something I have wanted to do for a long time that I think is a useful skill no matter what direction I choose to go in, If I don’t go into video games or some other creative outlet I would like to work for the Department of Conservation or with animals in some way (using my tech skills)
            </p>
          <h3>2.	A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
            <p>
              I am great when it comes to learning by doing, practical over theoretical. I learn through repetition and putting things to use that I have just learned in order to better retain the information. This can become a limitation rather than a strength however if I either don’t have the time to repeat the process a lot or if it is a difficult/boring process to repeat. It can also cause issues when there is no practical way to learn about something, like trying to learn about abstract stuff can be more difficult for me if I can’t understand how, it works and screw with it.
            </p>
          <h3>3.	What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>
              Definitely my time management, organization and planning. I have learnt a lot so far already about these things as it seems to be a core part of the early foundations which makes a lot of sense as it’s something you need to be able to properly absorb knowledge and learn. I also would like to learn how to better mesh with a team and create group projects as I personally have always struggled in those kinds of social situations. Practice makes perfect.
            </p>
          <h3>4.	A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program + A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
            <p>
              I have struggled with managing the workload thus far due to my personal circumstances, however with assistance from Naomi I have a guideline for how to catch back up with the rest of the cohort. I am working on getting my schedule back to normal so I can get up early and sleep a full night in order to properly align with the time that other people are working. I also need to keep in mind the levels of support that I can reach out to if things start to become too overwhelming, I have already had a chat with Joseph from Human Skills about my mental health, if the work load or stress starts to get to me, I will reach out to them again, or speak with a Facilitator/Naomi
            </p>
          <h3>5.	A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
            <p>
              Guidance, support and understanding. Based on what I have learned about the learning process in foundations I don’t expect constant teaching and micro management, instead I have to process and read the handbook and follow the sprints, the facilitation team is there to support and assist but not manage. This is healthier for learning as it helps me to remember how to learn, how to seek information myself and how to problem solve! (the best skill)
            </p>
          <h3>6.	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
            <p>
              Due to my personal circumstance of breaking up with my long-term partner. I don’t currently have any block out times or external commitments, I have recently fallen behind because of things like helping the move out and finding a flat mate but that is now out of the way. I now just need to get my mental health and motivation to a manageable level, and focus on Dev Academy.
