            <h3>1.	What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>I want to do something involving creativity and potentially video games. Learning coding/programming is something I have wanted to do for a long time that I think is a useful skill no matter what direction I choose to go in, If I don’t go into video games or some other creative outlet I would like to work for the Department of Conservation or with animals in some way (using my tech skills)</p>
            <h3>2.	A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
            <p>I am great when it comes to learning by doing, practical over theoretical. I learn through repetition and putting things to use that I have just learned in order to better retain the information. This can become a limitation rather than a strength however if I either don’t have the time to repeat the process a lot or if it is a difficult/boring process to repeat. It can also cause issues when there is no practical way to learn about something, like trying to learn about abstract stuff can be more difficult for me if I can’t understand how, it works and screw with it.</p>
            <h3>3.	What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>Definitely my time management, organization and planning. I have learnt a lot so far already about these things as it seems to be a core part of the early foundations which makes a lot of sense as it’s something you need to be able to properly absorb knowledge and learn. I also would like to learn how to better mesh with a team and create group projects as I personally have always struggled in those kinds of social situations. Practice makes perfect.</p>
            <h3>4.	A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program + A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
            <p>I have struggled with managing the workload thus far due to my personal circumstances, however with assistance from Naomi I have a guideline for how to catch back up with the rest of the cohort. I am working on getting my schedule back to normal so I can get up early and sleep a full night in order to properly align with the time that other people are working. I also need to keep in mind the levels of support that I can reach out to if things start to become too overwhelming, I have already had a chat with Joseph from Human Skills about my mental health, if the work load or stress starts to get to me, I will reach out to them again, or speak with a Facilitator/Naomi</p>
            <h3>5.	A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
            <p>Guidance, support and understanding. Based on what I have learned about the learning process in foundations I don’t expect constant teaching and micro management, instead I have to process and read the handbook and follow the sprints, the facilitation team is there to support and assist but not manage. This is healthier for learning as it helps me to remember how to learn, how to seek information myself and how to problem solve! (the best skill)</p>
            <h3>6.	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
            <p>Due to my personal circumstance of breaking up with my long-term partner. I don’t currently have any block out times or external commitments, I have recently fallen behind because of things like helping the move out and finding a flat mate but that is now out of the way. I now just need to get my mental health and motivation to a manageable level, and focus on Dev Academy.</p>
